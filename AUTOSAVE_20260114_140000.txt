[00:00.00]  country-led agreement around that process. We're also thinking that at the same conference that
[00:08.66]  we can not only get agreement about what actions should be taken, but also importantly, of those
[00:14.52]  actions, what are the actions that benefit from collaboration internationally? Certainly,
[00:23.48]  all actions benefit from information sharing across borders. I've done it this way. You could
[00:28.46]  do it that way, too. I think of things like the citizen assemblies, for example. But what I'm
[00:35.84]  thinking of in that context of where does it make sense, and I reflect back on what I was saying
[00:41.56]  in the beginning around liability, where does it make sense for countries to come up with a
[00:47.96]  consistent approach to particular actions across countries, wherein it may be certainly of greater
[00:57.22]  benefit to both
[00:58.44]  countries and industry and arguably the public if there is consistency around the approach.
[01:06.60]  So the purpose of the conference would not be to go into the depths of working out
[01:10.88]  how to make things consistent across countries, but it would identify these are the areas where
[01:18.90]  that type of consistency is beneficial, which naturally would then create the post-conference
[01:24.92]  action of how do we get to some sort of agreement?
[01:28.44]  So that's what the conference is all about and how we're actually thinking of it. I will share that
[01:44.16]  in advance of the conference. So I talked about this conference back in December when I was in
[01:54.74]  Nairobi for Health AI. So I'm going to talk about it in a little bit. But I'm going to talk about it in a little bit.
[01:58.44]  Our member Paling who likely is not here today because she told me she is in Vietnam, talking to the
[02:07.58]  government there.
[02:10.90]  And, you know, I say that and I was expecting to see her pop up.
[02:15.58]  But so at the inaugural meeting, so Health AI brought together all the people who are working on
[02:23.10]  collaboration for regulation of AI and health together at their first meeting,
[02:28.44]  uh in Nairobi and I was able uh to create have room at that conference to talk about
[02:34.54]  this action plan and uh how we're planning and moving things forward because the again the whole
[02:42.28]  emphasis of this work is it is better for us to be doing some of this work collaboratively and
[02:49.10]  together because it is to our mutual benefit to have consistent approaches around us this is some
[02:55.04]  of the work is foundational it should be down the same this is not impugn or impinge on the areas
[03:02.94]  of competitive advantage so got some feedback from the group there uh I'm currently talking with
[03:10.22]  uh Afrodita who is on the call with us today and the digital transformation of health lab
[03:15.54]  and doing a pre-consultation uh of some groups in Geneva uh around the middle of February
[03:23.38]  around the middle of March
[03:24.82]  sorry I misspoke uh in order to get additional input because this conference that we have in
[03:30.14]  Madrid uh is also going to be constrained in terms of the number of attendees to 160
[03:35.66]  and so the opportunities to have some of the pre-consultations with people in order to get
[03:42.36]  their meaningful input into the action plan I think would be beneficial in terms of the quality
[03:47.60]  of the product as well as its overall distribution I'm going to stop there because my throat is
[03:53.74]  starting to wear out a little bit
[03:54.82]  before I go into uh the next part but any questions or comments about anything that I have said today
[04:04.70]  oh thanks Anton sounds good thanks Leah okay that works um I got myself a moment to breathe
[04:24.82]  which is helpful um cool so I'm happy with that where things are at uh for uh for the action plan
[04:37.34]  um and I'll come back to your point there and secondly uh literally it's the next part of the
[04:44.54]  agenda so where we're at in terms of getting people uh I suppose the right word is nominated
[04:53.62]  for the conference
[04:54.82]  um because in many ways it would just look like to invite everybody who's on this call
[05:00.50]  um but sadly what I had to do was I went to country delegations and I asked them
[05:10.06]  to identify who the experts they would have attend the conference because I'm limited in
[05:17.44]  Spain to a total of 160 people which while it sounds like a lot when
[05:24.82]  uh you add up the people from all the different organizations who couldn't attend it would uh we'd
[05:31.66]  run out of room pretty quickly so we told the delegations to pick two uh people to nominate
[05:38.20]  per country and we asked them to get us feedback on that by the end of this month
[05:44.68]  um and so I shall see where the nominations for that go uh we've received several to date by about
[05:53.74]  five or six uh I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't know I don't
[05:54.82]  know uh countries have applied so far uh and I am fully expecting that there will be many many more
[06:01.36]  that will come in the next two weeks before the end of the month um sadly there is no hybrid option
[06:07.72]  to participate simply because there is um uh the way we are planning which actually I didn't say
[06:15.16]  this either um the way we're planning on running the session in uh Madrid is highly highly
[06:23.68]  interactive
[06:24.82]  um we're planning on uh the discussions to be in three parts uh at the meeting three major parts
[06:36.34]  um the first being around the engagements and the civil society perspectives and really what does
[06:43.96]  health delivery look like after AI has been integrated into the overall system
[06:51.52]  um and this is where we have some leading thinkers
[06:54.82]  uh I know from the UK and otherwise who've been doing a lot of work in this space to really think
[07:00.88]  about what does this uh uh look like and we're planning on then breaking the group up to 160 into
[07:08.32]  several smaller groups to really dive into specific aspects of what does this mean with respect to you
[07:14.68]  know patient perspectives provider perspectives industry perspective Etc what are the what do we
[07:20.20]  think it's going to look like what barriers to get there and how do we overcome the barriers I know
[07:25.38]  actions to overcome those barriers reflected in our action plan. You'll notice the theme.
[07:31.94]  The second part is going to be around enablement. So this is where, how do we create the enabling
[07:39.38]  environment wherein AI solutions can be developed, shared, approved, and scaled, and monitored
[07:47.70]  effectively on a go-forward basis, and where we are overcoming the pilotitis that many countries
[07:56.82]  have been struck with, where everybody is doing their own thing with respect to AI solutions,
[08:03.30]  and then we find that it can neither scale nor do we get the economic value out of the investments
[08:10.34]  because the ability to receive value from the scale of the solutions are themselves limited.
[08:18.10]  So scale comes into this in two ways. One, efficient development, and two, economic returns.
[08:25.78]  And then the third section of the agenda is really around the guardrails that need to be in place.
[08:33.86]  And the guardrails are things like, how do we make sure that the
[08:39.54]  medical device approval processes are being updated to incorporate it? How do we,
[08:45.70]  what new rules do we need?
[08:47.94]  In order to make sure things are safe on a go-forward basis, how do the people who are
[08:52.82]  these new AI safety officers, how do they interact on a day-to-day basis?
[08:58.82]  And so to speak, what are the regulations that need to be in place in that?
[09:03.46]  So that is, in each of those three sections, I envision that there are some opportunities
[09:10.18]  to break apart the group in order to get into detailed discussions, do some real thinking about
[09:17.86]  where there is opportunity for cross-border collaboration, information sharing, and or
[09:24.26]  development of actual policy solutions, and then come back together to make sure that we are
[09:30.02]  really focused on it. The idea is all of that is bookended into two parts.
[09:36.66]  At the very, very beginning, we'd have some sort of statements from ministers
[09:41.78]  really charging the group with, this is what I need from you. And then at the back end of the, oh,
[09:47.62]  where are we? What are the people who are, who are using this information that we can echoes.
[09:51.46]  I'm saying, what are you talking about? If we get these kind of things,
[09:54.42]  we can actually work it out with a group of speakers in an actual,
[09:57.78]  on a given setting. So we can talk about having a group of speakers come on and just sort of
[10:01.46]  present what they're going to think. What do we need? Where are we? What are we going to respect?
[10:04.90]  What are we going to discuss? You're just going to be able to go around the office.
[10:08.10]  So, you know, we're able to think about what is going to be in this number.
[10:09.78]  So I'm hoping that you'll be able to do that without going to the office.
[10:12.42]  I'm also hoping that we're able to come back to here to get into the contents.
[10:13.38]  I'm hoping that we're able to come back to this conversation about what's in our hands,
[10:14.58]  hybrid option but so that the reason to not have a hybrid option is because of the the value of
[10:22.02]  the interactivity of the various audience besides Madrid at the end of May is pretty cool so well
[10:28.16]  it's not cool at all so that'll be nice so I will now pause again
[10:36.58]  that I think I've now said everything have I said everything have I said everything
[10:42.78]  and you've been on vacation
[10:44.82]  um but day three debrief with this group I like that idea Carla
[10:54.34]  I think that's actually a good idea please to see your hand is up
[10:58.68]  um yes it is uh sorry um so I'm I'm thinking about the last piece when you talk about guardrails
[11:08.90]  can we include or have you thought to include something where they're
[11:12.78]  patients would have redress if something goes amiss we need to think about
[11:17.94]  processes whereby patients caregivers can deal with any fallout unfortunate fallout from the use
[11:27.30]  of AI I have to go back and say when I got feedback from uh the action plan that I sent out
[11:37.72]  one of the specific words and I forget if I
[11:42.78]  if I had to remove it or not but whatever uh so the idea would be there
[11:47.94]  I would say at least is we should make sure explicitly
